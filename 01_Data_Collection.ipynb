Either way, it\\'s unwise to trust them.** \\n\\n\\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it\\'s just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\\n\\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you\\'ll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you\\'ll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \\n\\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don\\'t give their names and callers aren\\'t allowed to request specific responders.  It\\'s much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it\\'s much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It\\'s partly about availability, but it\\'s mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \\n\\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it\\'s much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can\\'t see or police PMs.)  \\n\\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There\\'s no reason why someone who\\'s truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \\n\\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they\\'ve primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone\\'s in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\\n\\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don\\'t recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.',\n","     'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say &amp;quot;PM me anytime&amp;quot; in a casual social context.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.

Don’t feel like you have to read this you may be here a while. You can call me J and this is my story of self harm. I am 17, of African descent. Where can I start?\\n\\nBeing born into a strong African Christian family, I was very devoted from a young age. I was that one annoying kid in your class when you were younger always saying “GOD IS REAL”. But anyway, you can imagine my shock when I discovered that I was gay. Mind you, I knew from a very young age that I was different. When other boys were out playing football, I was inside watching Winx club and playing with dolls. I was, and still am quite femme and flamboyant but oh well. \\n\\nI remember I started cutting when I was in third year in secondary school, due to stress and depression. I found out how people felt about me (how they thought I was gay) and talked behind my back and that’s how it started. I can only describe the feeling as slowly open the cap of a bottle under so much intense pressure. Then my mum found out. I will never forget what she said when she discovered my scars. She responded with anger at how I betrayed God and forced me to fast and beg God for forgiveness. That’s when I started questioning my faith. Why did I have to apologise for feeling helpless? For something I couldn’t control?  \\n\\nI eventually got clean after that and didn’t cut anymore. A few years passed, and here I am today. Even worse than before. I can’t fully live in my truth because if my parents or anyone in the black community in my town find out, it’ll be a fate worse than death. My family and community would disown me or even worse. I’ve tried telling my story to different people in hopes that they’d have a solution, but to no avail. I’ve tried fasting and praying in hopes that maybe God will answer my prayers or at least give me the strength to keep on living without hating myself but stuff has gotten even worse. I’ve tried talking to other Christians and other people who have no idea what I’m talking about but you know how that shit goes. Either no adequate answers or “Don’t question God, he knows better” or “You chose to be this way just stop” or empty fucking words like “God works best when people are down”. Well how fucking down do I have to be for him to answer my fucking cries? Do I have to kill myself to get an answer? \\n\\n A few weeks ago I found a razor in my school bag and eventually went back to cutting and self harm a few weeks ago when this shit I have to carry, 6th Year exams, family and the depression got so much worse. It especially hurts when the people you thought loved you and your friends eventually left you and don’t look at you the same way anymore. I’m just so sick of feeling this way.   I don’t want to be looked at like I’m sick or “in need or curing”. I don’t want to be a trophy or testimony or an “ex-gay” convert either. It took me a long time to actually love myself and who I am. But all I want is to be normal. Why do I have to choose between my religion or my happiness when straight people can have both? If God is so perfect why did he make me this way? Why do I have to suffer like I do? I know everyone has their own troubles but mine are too much for me to bear. The future really isn’t looking good for me at all at the moment and sooner or later, my family will have to find out. It’s just a ticking time bomb, counting day after day not knowing when it’s going to explode. \\n\\nWhy am I telling my story? To be honest, I don’t know. Maybe for a sense of release I guess? I found this community some days ago when I was feeling very down and was reluctant to join at first, but you people really seem to be my people. You guys really seem to  understand what it’s like to reach the bottom and how I feel. And if you’re reading this I want you to know that I see you too. I know how you feel. \\n\\nTo end on a better note, what do I want most from life? The only thing that I want from life is to be surrounded people that love me and I love them. \\nHopefully I’ll find my tribe and actually be happy and satisfied and I hope you do too. \\n\\nIf you made it this far. Thank you for listening to my story. I really do hope things do get better for you and I’m sending you as much good vibes and energy as possible. \\n\\n-J.',\n","     'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my Story.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone.

I always make sure that I clean my room but I just have to wait for a good day and she doesn’t understand that. Please help me and give me tips to talk with her?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n","     'send_replies': True,\n","     'spoiler': False,\n","     'stickied': False,\n","

appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We\\'re hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \\n\\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it\\'s much better to respond in public comments, at least until you\\'ve gotten to know someone.

PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it\\'s unwise to trust them.** \\n\\n\\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it\\'s just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\\n\\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you\\'ll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you\\'ll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \\n\\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don\\'t give their names and callers aren\\'t allowed to request specific responders.  It\\'s much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it\\'s much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It\\'s partly about availability, but it\\'s mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \\n\\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it\\'s much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can\\'t see or police PMs.)  \\n\\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There\\'s no reason why someone who\\'s truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \\n\\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they\\'ve primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone\\'s in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\\n\\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don\\'t recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.',\n"," 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say &amp;quot;PM me anytime&amp;quot; in a casual social context.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.

It&amp;#39;s partly about availability, but it&amp;#39;s mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it&amp;#39;s much harder for others, including the &lt;a href=\"/r/depression\"&gt;/r/depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/r/SuicideWatch\"&gt;/r/SuicideWatch&lt;/a&gt; moderators to help&lt;/strong&gt;.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can&amp;#39;t see or police PMs.)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our observation over many years, the people who say &amp;quot;PM me&amp;quot; the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. &lt;strong&gt;There&amp;#39;s no reason why someone who&amp;#39;s truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny&lt;/strong&gt;.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. &lt;strong&gt;If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they&amp;#39;ve primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.&lt;/strong&gt; This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone&amp;#39;s in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don&amp;#39;t recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n"," 'send_replies': True,\n"," 'spoiler': False,\n"," 'stickied': True,\n"," 'subreddit': 'depression',\n","
